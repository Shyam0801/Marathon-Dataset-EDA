# Marathon-Dataset-EDA

This Project showcases my Python skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The project involves analyzing a dataset by filtering specific data, performing various analyses, and visualizing the results.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on filtering and analyzing data from the USA for the year 2020, particularly looking at event distances of 50km and 50 miles. The main goals are to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and generate insightful visualizations.

## Key Steps and Techniques

### 1. Data Filtering

- **Objective:** Extract relevant data from the dataset, specifically for the USA and events in the year 2020 with distances of 50km and 50 miles.
- **Techniques Used:** Data slicing and conditional filtering using pandas.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- **Objective:** Ensure the dataset is free of inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant data.
- **Techniques Used:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Objective:** Gain insights into the dataset through statistical analysis and visualizations.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
  - Visualization techniques including bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and line charts using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Insights Gained

- **Distribution of Event Distances:** Analyzed the frequency and distribution of event distances within the specified criteria.
- **Trends Over Time:** Investigated trends and patterns over the year 2020 to identify any significant changes or notable events.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Explored the geographical distribution of events within the USA to identify regions with higher event occurrences.

## Visualizations

The project includes several key visualizations to represent the data effectively:

- **Bar Plots:** To compare categorical data.
- **Histograms:** To show the distribution of numerical data.
- **Scatter Plots:** To explore relationships between two numerical variables.
- **Line Charts:** To observe trends over time.

## Tool Used

- I used the Jupyter Notebook to do this Exploratory Data Analysis
- Used the libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn.
